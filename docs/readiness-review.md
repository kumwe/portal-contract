# Extraction readiness review — 2026-09-07

Candidate version: `0.2.0`. Published baseline: `0.1.0`.

Add an owned, versioned admission envelope with a mandatory canonical Capability, same-owner references and explicit exposure defaulting to false. Bound declaration paths/templates and UTF-8 labels.

The existing source map remains the extraction provenance record. Content and Navigation use App baseline `24ecf956423c18933e824b43cea1bfb9127a79a9`; the surface declarations and business contracts preserve the SDK provenance in docs/source-map.json. This review adds portable boundary behavior and package-owned tests without changing App production code or test ownership.

## Runtime boundary

`PortalContributionAdmission` is an immutable declaration envelope, not an authorization result. It uses released ContributionOwner, SurfaceIdentifierPolicy and Capability. It validates definition ownership, referenced workspace/view/template/surface ownership and preservation of any declared route/navigation capability. Existing constructors and toArray declaration shapes remain intact. Every view/workspace receives its explicit access descriptor through the envelope. The host must separately evaluate trust, lifecycle, execution context and permissions before registry activation or dispatch.

Portal exposure is false unless the caller explicitly supplies exposed: true. The flag records the declaration's opt-in; it never grants access. Consumers must use the admission envelope for all portal declaration kinds and enforce both the flag and the required capability.

Paths are limited to 2048 bytes and template references to 255 bytes. Labels, descriptions and keywords retain their existing character budgets and must be valid UTF-8. Existing SDK renderer/factory bindings accept PSR HTTP requests/handlers and therefore remain SDK/host delivery contracts. Copying those interfaces here would violate the explicit HTTP exclusion; this package exposes neutral owned declarations instead. It creates no alternate renderer, dispatcher, authentication flow or active registry.

## Verification and remaining release steps

Package-owned regression tests cover the changed invariants. The public API gate now compares generated Markdown as well as JSON, including full method signatures, defaults, public properties and constant values; source file order is sorted before generation. No ConfigProvider is introduced because these values, pure algorithms and ports have no injected runtime coordinator.

Local source validation uses PHP 8.5.10 and exact dependency-tag archives where registry access is unavailable. This is distinct from the supported Composer security and built-archive consumer gates in CI. Merge only after the complete package workflow passes. The candidate is not a published or independently release-verified artifact. Publication, independent artifact verification and a coordinated exact-pin consumer train remain required before App integration. App acceptance, authorization, lifecycle, persistence and browser tests remain App-owned and were not run or claimed by this package review.
