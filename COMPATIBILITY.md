# Compatibility

Requires PHP 8.5. The source map records a deliberate namespace ownership break; no aliases or dual class declarations are shipped. Canonical packages own imported types. Exceptions and wire shapes remain inherited unless a decision below documents a change. Independent release verification is required before a consumer exact-pins a stable version.

## 0.2.0 boundary corrections

Add an owned, versioned admission envelope with a mandatory canonical Capability, same-owner references and explicit exposure defaulting to false. Bound declaration paths/templates and UTF-8 labels. Public constructor parameter order and declaration serialization remain compatible; malformed/unbounded or externally mutable inputs are rejected or detached as documented in [the Core contract](docs/core-contract.md). App adoption must use the released public API and keep host integration tests in App.
